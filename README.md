# Unique_ptr_implementation
An implementation of the "unique_ptr" class and some of its function. 

Unique pointer is one of the most used smart pointers, Smart pointers were created to avoid memory leaks and improve the performance of the code by deleteing themselves automatically when they go out of the scope . Unique pointer has special properties, the most important one is : it can't be copied. 
In this repositry, I implemented the class of the unique pointer and its main functions: 
1. release()
2.reset()
3.get()
